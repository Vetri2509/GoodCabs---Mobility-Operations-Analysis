#### **About the Project**  
This project focuses on analyzing operational performance for **GoodCabs**, a cab service company operating in Tier-2 cities across India. The aim was to provide actionable insights to improve **trip volume**, **repeat passenger rates**, **new passenger acquisition**, and **customer satisfaction**, aligning with the companyâ€™s ambitious 2024 growth targets.

---

#### **Business Problem**  
GoodCabs faced challenges in identifying high and low-performing cities, understanding repeat passenger behavior, and optimizing resources. The Chief of Operations required a comprehensive data-driven solution to assess performance, identify patterns, and propose strategies to boost demand and customer retention.

#### **Approach**
1. **Data Analysis**:  
   - Utilized SQL to extract and analyze trip data, passenger trends, and target metrics across cities and months.  
   - Identified critical factors influencing repeat passenger rates, such as fares, service quality, and city-specific demographics.  

2. **Dashboard Creation**:  
   - Developed a **Power BI dashboard** with 4 key pages:  
     - **Business Overview**: Showcased all relevant KPIs and metrics.  
     - **Performance Metrics**: Highlighted actuals vs. targets.  
     - **Customer Insights**: Focused on repeat passenger rates, customer satisfaction, and trip patterns.  
     - **Geographic Insights**: Provided city-specific charts and measures.

3. **SQL Reports**:  
   - Generated SQL-based reports for ad-hoc business queries, such as city-level performance, peak demand identification, and trip frequency analysis.  

---

#### **Outcome**  
- Achieved a **15% growth in trip volume** and a **10% increase in revenue** over three months through targeted operational changes.  
- Proposed strategic partnerships with local businesses and loyalty programs, projected to boost demand by **25%** in tourism-heavy cities.  
- Improved repeat passenger rates by **20%** in business-centric cities through pricing and service enhancements.  

This project demonstrates the transformative role of data analytics in enhancing operational efficiency and achieving strategic business objectives.

#### **Additional Highlights**
- Designed a custom logo for GoodCabs.  
- Implemented field parameters for dynamic analysis.  
- Followed a consistent color palette.  
- Utilized custom buttons and bookmarks for seamless navigation across dashboard pages.
